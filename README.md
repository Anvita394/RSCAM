# Research in Computational Applied Mathematics: Role of Metropolisation in Sampling Schemes 

## This project explores the usage of different stochastic methods and Metropolised methods for various different cases of the potential energy function. It investigates and compares the accuracy, order of convergence and effciency of the schemes used and takes into consideration the cost of the acceptance step as well the computational time, along with looking at the benefits of restricting to the true distribution.
